## 📚 Steps to deploy bot to heroku

1. I suggest fork the [Bot-Wa](https://github.com/Paiiss/bot-wa/fork) repo / Directly click the purple deploy heroku button [here](https://github.com/Paiiss/bot-wa/) (sorry if you are color blind)
2. Please create a heroku account/login first
3. Enter the application name and Fill Config Vars depending on your needs
4. Deploy the application, you have to wait for the build app to finish
5. If you have then there is a view button under the app build log, click and wait for the qr to appear and scan the qr
6. If you want to change the footer / other config, you can edit it in the `app.json` file
